About the Meridian Families Collection
The Meridian History Center has accummulated hundreds of documents, images and objects associated with the lives of many of Meridian's original settler families. These are the families that shaped Meridian's future and helped turn it into the thriving city it is today.

This project was made possible by a SHARP Operations Grant, funded by the Idaho Humanities Council and National Endowment for the Humanities.
